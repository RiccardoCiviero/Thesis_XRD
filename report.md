# Report for XRD analysis of dislocations

Main points:
1. Misfit should be seen in peak broadening along $\omega$ / rocking curves 
2. Threading should instead be the high-q behaviour (the tails of the $\omega$ curves)

Tasks:
1. Identify name of .dat files
2. Setup Danny's XRD tools in a decent environment
3. Convert (rotate) .dat files
4. Setup a .ipynb file
5. Find a way to extract only the profile you want
6. Fit

1. rsms are explicit in their filenames. 1.5deg is the 004 while 2.0deg is the 224. The E4 is the annealed one while usually the E5 is as grown 

2. Almost done (i hope) maybe a switch to poetry would be nice
